# Client Scopes - Setup tab

For the Setup page in Client scopes of a Client, we got rid of the old patterns and used PF4 tables to display all the Assigned client scopes. Also, I added a column of description for each client scope, which allowed users to add some descriptions while creating new client scopes.

As for adding available client scopes, click the blue Add button and choose target client scopes in a pop-up Modal page, the current client scopes have 4 types(always, default, optional, required). Users can select multiple client scopes and add them to one of these 4 types.

## Layout improvements

* The landing page displaying all the assigned client scopes in a table format.
* Add a Description column for each client scope.
